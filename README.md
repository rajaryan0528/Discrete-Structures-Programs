## DiscreteStructuresPrograms

This project file contains the source codes for the questions prescribed by the UOD for the _B.Sc(Hons.) CS_ course in the paper on **Discrete Structures**.

### Searching algorithms:

1.Linear search  
2.Binary search

### Sorting algorithms:

1.Bubble Sort

2.Selection Sort

3.Insertion Sort

_The number of comparisons during each pass was also calculated for the bubble sort and displayed and this observed values were used to plot a graph to analyze the complexity of algorithm.Matplotlib library of python was utilized for this task._

### Questions from practical list were also added.

**_There are also other questions from the practical list ranging from implementing a set to a relation , and to various problems on graphs and recursion._**

Note: Source Codes for a few question are yet to be added.
